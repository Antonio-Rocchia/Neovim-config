# Neovim configuration
This is my neovim configuration made with lua.

## Version 2024.1

### Wants
- [ ] Get better at using marks and macros
- [ ] Diff integration
    - I tried it when I used neogit and its very useful

### Removed
- Git integration with Neogit
    - I prefer using git on the command line or with lazygit in tmux
